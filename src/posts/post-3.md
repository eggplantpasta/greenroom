title: ToDo (the original list)
---

This is the original list of tasks I was working off to get the boat ready for club racing and the annual [Rottnest Race (D'Arcy)](https://efyc.com.au/event/darcy-race/). It worked for getting the boat to a minimal standard to use for those things but it's not enough to act as a project plan to complete all the things I want to do to it.

I've since read the awesome book _[This Old Boat](https://www.amazon.com.au/This-Old-Boat-Don-Casey/dp/0071579931)_ by [Don Casey](https://www.amazon.com.au/stores/Don-Casey/author/B001IGOSIK) which has a much more organised way of compiling and organising a proper project plan from a list like this. I'll be following the method he explains to create a more methodical project plan.
