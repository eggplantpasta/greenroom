## The Current Engine

The boat is currently powered by a 54lb thrust long shaft [WaterSnake electric outboard](https://www.watersnake.com.au/products/watersnake-venom-sxw-transom-mount-motors). At max power it uses ~40 amps @ 12v (~0.5kW) and can run for 1 hour and 20 minutes on the 138Ah gel battery.

The motor can push the boat at 2 knots maximum in no wind at slack tide. This is not enough when either the tide or wind is against you and does not allow, for example,  getting under the bridges against the tide or picking up a mooring against the wind.

## Upgrade Options

From cheapest on up.

### Larger 12v Motor Only ($755)

The maximum thrust a 12v system allows is something like a [70lb brushless motor](https://www.watersnake.com.au/collections/watersnake-electric-motors/products/watersnake-advance-brushless-transom-mount-motors). This ~30% increase is not great enough to overcome the present limitations and so a move to 24v is needed.

### Dual motors ($829)

* another 12 v 54lb Watersnake ($289 Anaconda)
* extra cable and plugs ($~$150)
* extra combined motor power switch ($70)
* extra circuit breaker ($120)
* extra motor mount and bolts ($200)

### Larger 24v 5hp equivalent motor ($1755)

* Haswing Protruar 5.0 Brushless Motor 160lbs Thrust 24V - 39" Shaft Electric Motor (max 105A ~2.5kW -5hp equivalent) ($1,399.00 )
* 5m twin core tinned  2 AWG ($230 )
* 2 x 120A Anderson plugs ($44 )
* 2 x waterproof boot (already acquired)
* Blue Sea 7188 120A 285 Series Circuit Breaker - Surface Mount ($82)

### + Extra battery ($1755 + $300 = $2055)

* existing charger
* Kings 12V 138Ah Deep Cycle Battery ($248)
* wire and terminals ($50)

### + Upgraded batteries ($1755 + $708 = $2463)
