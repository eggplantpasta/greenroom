## The Current System

The boat is currently powered by a 54lb thrust long shaft [WaterSnake electric outboard](https://www.watersnake.com.au/products/watersnake-venom-sxw-transom-mount-motors). At max power it uses ~40 amps @ 12v (~0.5kW) and can run for 1 hour and 20 minutes on the 138Ah gel battery.

The motor can push the boat at 2 knots maximum in no wind at slack tide. This is not enough when either the tide or wind is against you and does not allow, for example,  getting under the bridges against the tide or picking up a mooring against the wind.

The maximum thrust a 12v system allows is something like a [70lb brushless motor](https://www.watersnake.com.au/collections/watersnake-electric-motors/products/watersnake-advance-brushless-transom-mount-motors). This ~30% increase is not great enough to overcome the present limitations and so a move to 24v is needed.
