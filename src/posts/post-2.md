I'm currently redoing my electrical system after my initial design failed due to some parts not up to spec. This time I'm going to over-engineer things and build for future expansion.

## Existing components

## Potential future components

I want a battery monitor so I can run my electric engine with less guesswork about range.

[Victron](https://victronenergy.com) seem to be well regarded. e.g. [SmartShunt](https://www.victronenergy.com/battery-monitors/smart-battery-shunt) with bluetooth interface.

ITechworld is neat and cheap [ITECHBM500 - 500A Battery Monitor With Shunt](https://itechworld.com.au/collections/battery-monitors/products/itechbm500-500-amp-battery-monitor-with-shunt-high-and-low-voltage-programmable-compatible-with-12v-lithium-sealed-gel-flooded-batteries)
