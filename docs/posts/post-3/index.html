        <h1>ToDo (the original list)</h1>
        <p>This is the original list of tasks I was working off to get the boat ready for club racing and the annual <a href="https://efyc.com.au/event/darcy-race/">Rottnest Race (D'Arcy)</a>. It worked for getting the boat to a minimal standard to use for those things but it's not enough to act as a project plan to complete all the things I want to do to it.</p>
<p>I've since read the awesome book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/This-Old-Boat-Don-Casey/dp/0071579931">This Old Boat</a></em> by <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/stores/Don-Casey/author/B001IGOSIK">Don Casey</a> which has a much more organised way of compiling and organising a proper project plan from a list like this. I'll be following the method he explains to create a more methodical project plan.</p>
